Description: A Python Library For The EduPython Kits
 ï»¿EduPython is meant for the CamJam EduKit's only and not for day to day usage
 of normal motors. With other GPIO libraries that work with the kits you still
 have to tell it where the motors or LED's are connected to but the CamJam
 resources stick to certain GPIO Pins so there is no need to 'Call' the GPIO
 pin numbers for the purpose of the CamJam kit's. EduPython will continue be
 maintained for the forseeable future. The purpose of this is to create a module 
 that school children could use in a short space of time and something that is
 not confusing and the language is self explanatory.
