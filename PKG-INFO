Description: ï»¿EduPython is meant for the CamJam EduKit's only and not for day to day usage
        of normal motors. With other GPIO libraries that work with the kits you still
        have to tell it where the motors or LED's are connected to but the CamJam
        resources stick to certain GPIO Pins so there is no need to 'Call' the GPIO
        pin numbers for the purpose of the CamJam kit's. EduPython will continue be
        maintained for the forseeable future. The purpose of this is to create a module 
        that school children could use in a short space of time and something that is
        not confusing and the language is self explanatory.
