If you go up a version:

- change version number in make_deb

- add new version to debian-jessie/changelog using exactly the same format.
    Newest version at the top.
    If in doubt, look at example in
      https://sourceforge.net/p/raspberry-gpio-python/code/ci/default/tree/debian_jessie/changelog

- change version number in setup.py

- Make sure it is all in github

- Add to pypi using:
  $ python3 setup.py sdist upload

- Create debian package using:
  $ ./make_deb
