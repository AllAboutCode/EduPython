EduPython is meant for the CamJam EduKit's only and not for day to day usage
of normal motors. With other GPIO libraries that work with the kits you still
have to tell it where the motors or LED's are connected to but the CamJam
resources stick to certain GPIO Pins so there is no need to 'Call' the GPIO
pin numbers for the purpose of the CamJam kit's. EduPython will continue be
maintained for the forseeable future. The purpose of this is to create a module 
that school children could use in a short space of time and something that is
not confusing and the language is self explanatory.
